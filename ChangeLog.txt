ChangeLog

	Fixes by Linuxgurugamer:

	Fixed node value being saved in Persisor.cs, line 457, was saving the vesselState as a vesselSituation
	Fixed a nullref when entering the editor, nullref was because constructionPlaylist
		was empty, and it appears that the game code is assuming there is always a playlist
	Fixed Nullref in SoundGui.cs when sted.ActivePlaylists was null
	Added InstallChecker to validate correct installation (untested)



The following changes were done using the ToolbarController, so it is not in
this version:
	Made left click open/close the player, right-click open the main gui
	Protected click-through through the windows to the scene below using the
		ClickThroughBlocker
	Added ability to put the button on either the stock toolbar or Blizzy's
		toolbar, using the ToolbarController
